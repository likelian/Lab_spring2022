TC Electronic's product?


Other:
Pitch Correction must be included

1. Find dataset
2. Read paper (simpler methods?)
3. Research on the market, app and hardware products

About proposal:
* options to solve the problem
* discuss about the options
* a realistic timeline
* a measure of success
* can copy plots/graphs from other papers, give citations
* listening test, properly design
what effects to be used?
Rule-based?


don’t get distracted from the goal


“I want to..” is fine, but the language should be scientific.



About the project:
* Blind (without reference)
* Non-blind (with reference)
* Both


To-Do:

1.  Research on the market, app and hardware products
2.  Try the software reverseDemo_mac from "reverse engineering the mix"
3.  Check DAMP dataset in the hard disk
4.  Start the proposal

**2/23**

**To-do:**

1. Iterative compression optimization
2. (Optional) Non-iterative compression optimization 
3. Define a plan of reverb parameter matching from impulse response
4. Define a rule-based reverb control from an existing tempo-reverbTime relationship in publications. Define it as linear by myself.
5. (Optional) Implement short-term loudness meter, and loudness range meter
6. Evaluation: current simple listening tests needs more data, a variety of songs
7. dynamic distribution as evaluation metric
8. A milestone-like progress report every week
